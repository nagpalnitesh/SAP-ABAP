# ABAP Programming #
ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming), is a fourth-generation programming language, used for development and customization purposes in the SAP software. <br />
Currently positioned along with Java, as the main language for SAP application server programming, most of the programs are executed under the control of the run-time system. 

## Project Development Using SAP ABAP ##

Objective of this project is to develop an application for faculty and students using ABAP 'Advance Business Application Programming'. <br />
In this project, faculty can read or write the details of students or faculty while the students only fill their details and read their respective details only. All this done by login to an account or by creating new account.

### Prerequisites ###
  * Basic Understanding of JAVA Programming and
  * Database Technologies like PL/SQL
  
### Benefits of SAP ABAP ###
  * Direct Access to specialist and niche skills as needed by the customer.
  * Ability to respond faster to the changes in demand.
  * Quicker Resource Availability and re-balancing for the need.
  * Standard Delivery Model, Process and Tools.
  * Cost Effective Resourcing due to factory approach.
  * Helps in reducing iteration cycles and costs for clients.
  * Established Quality Processes and Procedures.
  * Immediate access to experienced ABAP consultants.
  * Dedicated onsite / offsite / offshore client engagement manager.
  * Proven ABAP Factory model.

### Features of SAP ABAP ###
  ABAP doesn't stand alone, and it is highly integrated with other features of the SAP NetWeaver ABAP application server.
  Among these are the following:
  * Logical database connections, which allow code to be abstracted from a specific database. The actual database connections are configured outside of ABAP code, allowing the same code to be used in different database environments.
  * Open SQL, an abstraction of SQL syntax that is part of the ABAP language and which the ABAP runtime environment converts to native SQL that is appropriate for the database being used. Open SQL has many similarities to Microsoft .NET's Language Integrated Query (LINQ) concept. 
  * Internal Tables, which hold collections of objects that are accessed using special language keywords or Open SQL. This ABAP concept contrasts with the concept of typed arrays like in Java or C++.
  * Security, in which ABAP is integrated with SAP NetWeaver's security infrastructure.
  * Data Dictionary, a universal dictionary of data structure definitions, often including  
business logic, which is available to all ABAP programs in a system.
  * Change and Transport System (CTS), which tracks changes to development objects and manages the promotion of development objects to quality assurance and production environments.
  * Shared development system, which is an important aspect of ABAP. ABAP differs from most newer languages in that development usually takes place on a shared
system, with all developers working on the same set of development objects at the same time.
